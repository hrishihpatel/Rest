# HTTP Methods
REST APIs enable you to develop any kind of web application having all possible CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations. REST guidelines suggest using a specific HTTP method on a specific type of call made to the server (though technically it is possible to violate this guideline, yet it is highly discouraged).

Use below-given information to find a suitable HTTP method for the action performed by API.

## HTTP GET
Use GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only – and not to modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods. Additionally, GET APIs should be idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests must produce the same result every time until another API (POST or PUT) has changed the state of the resource on the server.

If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.

For any given HTTP GET API, if the resource is found on the server, then it must return HTTP response code 200 (OK) – along with the response body, which is usually either XML or JSON content (due to their platform-independent nature).

In case resource is NOT found on server then it must return HTTP response code 404 (NOT FOUND). Similarly, if it is determined that GET request itself is not correctly formed then server will return HTTP response code 400 (BAD REQUEST).

### Example request URIs
* HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users
* HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users?size=20&page=5
* HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users/123
* HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/address

## HTTP POST
Use POST APIs to create new subordinate resources, e.g., a file is subordinate to a directory containing it or a row is subordinate to a database table. Talking strictly in terms of REST, POST methods are used to create a new resource into the collection of resources.

Ideally, if a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be HTTP response code 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header.

Many times, the action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either HTTP response code 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status.

Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields.

Please note that POST is neither safe nor idempotent, and invoking two identical POST requests will result in two different resources containing the same information (except resource ids).

### Example request URIs
* HTTP POST http://www.appdomain.com/users
* HTTP POST http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/accounts

## HTTP Put
Use PUT APIs primarily to update existing resource (if the resource does not exist, then API may decide to create a new resource or not). If a new resource has been created by the PUT API, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the HTTP response code 201 (Created) response and if an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.

If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.

```
The difference between the POST and PUT APIs can be observed in request URIs. POST requests are made on resource collections, whereas PUT requests are made on an individual resource.
```

### Example request URIs
* HTTP PUT http://www.appdomain.com/users/123
* HTTP PUT http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/accounts/456

## HTTP DELETE
As the name applies, DELETE APIs are used to delete resources (identified by the Request-URI).

A successful response of DELETE requests SHOULD be HTTP response code ```200 (OK)``` if the response includes an entity describing the status, ```202 (Accepted)``` if the action has been queued, or ```204 (No Content)``` if the action has been performed but the response does not include an entity.

DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it’s removed from the collection of resources. Repeatedly calling DELETE API on that resource will not change the outcome – however, calling DELETE on a resource a second time will return a ```404 (NOT FOUND)``` since it was already removed. Some may argue that it makes the DELETE method non-idempotent. It’s a matter of discussion and personal opinion.

If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.
